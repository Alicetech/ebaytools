Ebay tools for mass checkout and feedback automation. Focus is on buyer account automation.

Only the chrome extension is available. 

With the chrome extension you  can click its icon in the toolbar and:
- "leave mass feedback" to leave up to 25. (25 limit is a defect by eBay)
- Leave postive or negative to all feedback on feedback.ebay.com. 
- Click "mark all positive" and it automatically fills in all 5 stars and leaves a message "Thanks A++++++++++"
- Click "mark all negative" and it automatically fills in all 1 stars and leaves a message "Did not arrive."

## todo

- Allow custom and random message for feedback
- Many other things to help buyers (open a issue to request a feature)
